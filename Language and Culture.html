		<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>First and foremost, I am a first year undergraduate <em>Language and Culture</em> student at UCL. Amongst other things, I am an amateur beginner coder, an avid reader and a hopeful writer. 
				<br>
				The most important thing I have come to realise is that there is no 'typical language student' - we're a mixed, eclectic bunch! 
				<br> 
				<br>
				For me personally, the main advantages of the <em>Language and Culture</em> course is the ability to tailor your own degree. That's the great thing about becoming a language student right here at UCL, you are in control and your options only become greater over the four year course! <br> My timetable is currently made up of: 
				<ul>
					<li> Use of French: French Grammar</li>
					<li> French Oral Classes</li>
					<li> Reading French Texts: Medieval French Literature</li>
					<li> Spanish Classes: Grammar, Oral, Reading, Writing, Culture</li>	
					<li> Poetry of the Afterlife: English Literature</li>
					<li> Language and Culture (Including things like gender studies, memory studies, the concept of culture and more!)</li>
				</ul>
