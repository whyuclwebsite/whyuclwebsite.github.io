					<h2>About the Course</h2>
					<p>Arts and Sciences is for those of you who are interested in everything and anything. It's a course that doesn't restrict you to one particular area of study. It lets you choose whatever you want.
			</br>
					When you are on this course you will be challenged, you will have people with completely different perspectives on the same issue and you will most likely be the only one doing all the modules you have chosen.</p>
				<h2>Modules: What modules can you have?</h2>
					<p>Firstly, our of the four available pathways you choose a major and a minor pathway. If you choose a <em>scienc-y</em> you have to chose an <em>arts-y</em> minor and vice versa.</p>
				<ul>
						<p><b>Science Pathways</b></p>
								<li><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc/prospective/pathways/health-environment/" target="_blank">Health and Environment</a></li>
								<li><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc/prospective/pathways/sciences-engineering/" target="_blank">Science and Engineering</a></li>
							<p><b>Arts Pathways</b></p>
								<li><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc/prospective/pathways/cultures/" target="_blank">Cultures</a></li>

				<p>Part of being a BASc student is having a knowledge and understanding in a lot of different areas....and languages are no exception!</P>
					<div>
				<p>You have to take a langauge as part of your degree. You can start a new one from scratch (like I did for <b>Mandarin</b>), or you can carry on one that you learnt at school. You choose the level you are most confident at.</p>
